    "Note that:\n",
    "➢ If model output is reported on a native grid, then if regridded output is also reported, it must not be labeled “gr”, but instead should be of the\n",

    "➢ The grid label provides no information about the grid other than to indicate whether or not the data have been regridded (from the native grid)\n",
    "and whether or not the grid is considered to be a “primary” grid by the data provider.\n",
    "➢ Output for different variables may be reported on different grids, so “gn” and “gr” may not uniquely define a grid even within a single model.\n",
    "➢ If a variable is reported on more than one grid, one of these grids must be labeled “gn” or “gr” (as appropriate), and others must be labeled as\n",
    "secondary grids (“gr1”, “gr2”, etc.).\n",
    "➢ The grid labels (“gr1”, “gr2”, etc.) must be defined consistently for all variables reported from a single model on the same secondary grid. Thus,\n",
    "if “gr3” indicates output on a 2x2 degree grid for one variable, then the same label should be used for other variables output on this grid (unless\n",
    "for another variable output is considered to be primary, in which case the output would be labeled “gn” or “gr”, as appropriate).\n",
    "➢ Output on the same grid but from different models will usually not be labeled with the same grid_label, since data providers independently\n",
    "assign the labels.\n",
    "➢ A “nominal_resolution” attribute must be defined as specified in Appendix 2, and a brief description of the grid should be recorded in the “grid”\n",
    "global attribute (see note 10).\n",
    "➢ For zonal mean output, a “z” should be appended to the grid label that would apply before performing the zonal mean (e.g., \"gnz\", \"grz\", \"gr2z\").\n",
    "The \"gnz\" label would likely only be appropriate when zonally-averaging data on a native cartesian latxlon grid.\n",
    "➢ For “site” data the label \"gn\" should be used presuming data are obtained from the single native grid cell located nearest each site.\n",
    "➢ For “transport through a straight” (and the like), the grid label should reflect the grid relied on in calculating the transport (presumably the\n",
    "native grid would be best for this purpose, so “gn”).\n",
    "➢ For output reported only over the region centered on Greenland, “g” should be appended to the grid_label (e.g., “gng”, “grg”, “gr1g”). Similarly\n",
